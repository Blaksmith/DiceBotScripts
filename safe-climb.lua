-- autoDivisor setting resets your bet on every win recovery.  
-- 	Formula is: basebet = balance / autoDivisor.  
-- 	The higher the divisor, the lower the bet.
-- 	Example: Balance = 20000 satoshi, autoDivisor = 5000, result = 4.
-- 				Balance = 200000 satoshi, autodivisor = 5000, result = 40.
-- 				Balance = 20000 satoshi, autodivisor = 50000, result = 0.4 (rounded to 1)
-- 				Balance = 200000 satoshi, autodivisor = 50000, result = 4

autoDivisor = 10000 -- Need to tweak this number a little more  Higher = lower bets

-- If you do not wish to use the auto tune, you will need to verify these few entries
